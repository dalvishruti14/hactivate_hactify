### 4. Technology Stack

Sensory Learn utilizes cutting-edge technologies to make its vision a reality. The platform leverages Google's Large Language Model (LLM), Gemini, to deliver personalized and effective educational experiences. In the future, we plan to extend our use of technology by incorporating Mediapipe, TensorFlow, Google Cloud, Google Text-to-Speech APIs, and more.

## Technology Stack
